**Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack**

- What is a ‘call’?

The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

Only one
- What does LIFO mean?

last in, first out
- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

- What causes a Stack Overflow?


The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.


**JavaScript error messages**

- What is a ‘reference error’?

The ReferenceError object represents an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced. ReferenceError is a serializable object, so it can be cloned with structuredClone() or copied between Workers using postMessage() .
- What is a ‘syntax error’?

A character or string incorrectly placed in a command or instruction that causes a failure in execution.
- What is a ‘range error’?

A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String.
- What is a ‘type error’?

The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type.
- What is a breakpoint?

In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes.
- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

Debugging means to run your code step by step in a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to find the exact point where you made a programming mistake.
