# Readings: Mongo and Mongoose

**nosql vs sql**

- Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined
- Give a real world example.

For instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database.
- Give a real world example.

NoSQL databases often store data in a form that is similar to the objects used in applications, reducing the need for translation from the form the data is stored in to the form the data takes in the code.
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Relational Databases
- Which type of database is best for scalability?

An Open source NoSQL key-value database.


**sql vs nosql (Video)**

- What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language
- What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
- What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database (RDB) is a way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns.
- What is a ‘schema’?

A semantic vocabulary of tags (or microdata) that you can add to your HTML to improve the way search engines read and represent your page in SERPs.
- What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases.
- How does it work?

It enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases
- What is inside of a Mongo database?

In MongoDB, a database contains the collections of documents. One can create multiple databases on the MongoDB server.
- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have
