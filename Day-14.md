# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

**Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding**

- What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The increase of marketing personal computers to men began in full force.
- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Because it became the narrative of who needs computers and who doesn't.
** Employee breakdown of key technology companies**

- When are diversity efforts most successful?

When comapnies offer a continuity, integration, and institutionalization of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
- Why do diverse companies perform better?

 When team members bring a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, they are more likely to solve problems and be innovative.
- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

Looking at it as a peer group situation. If you are at a company creating a product with your own experiences in mind. You'll be able to make a much more accepted product, becuase your experience will speak to a much more diverse pool of potential users.
